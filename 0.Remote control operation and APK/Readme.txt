Since the online webpage programming of microbit official website has been revised, 
our Bluetooth remote control program cannot be directly imported into the microbit drive letter from the online program. 
Otherwise, Bluetooth will not be able to connect properly, even if the Bluetooth connection is used, the APP will flash back when it is used.

Solution:
1. Directly use the hex file we provided£¬ you need to drag the hex file directly to the microbit drive letter. 
(Note: you cannot import our Bluetooth remote control program into online programming, otherwise the Bluetooth module cannot be used)
